## Purpose

This GitHub organization serves as a central resource for documentation, protocols, and training materials related to MRI-based research. Materials are intended to support onboarding, reproducibility, and day-to-day workflows for students, staff, and collaborators.

## Contents

You’ll find resources covering:

- 🧠 **Data organization**  
  Guidance for structuring datasets according to the [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (Brain Imaging Data Structure) standard

- 🔄 **Data conversion and preprocessing**  
  Documentation and example workflows using:
  - [HeuDiConv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv): DICOM-to-BIDS conversion
  - [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org): preprocessing pipeline for functional and anatomical MRI
  - [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/): tools for image analysis and statistical modeling

- 🎓 **Training materials**  
  Walkthroughs, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and lab guides for students, research assistants, and new team members

## Status

> ⚠️ **Under Development**  
> These pages are actively being developed. Content will expand over time as additional materials are finalized and shared.
